Hi, I'm Théo Michelot.

I'm an assistant professor in statistics at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada. 

I mostly work on time series models for ecology, including hidden Markov models, state-space models, and stochastic differential equations. I have (co-)developed a few R packages to make those methods more accessible, which you can find on my Github profile.
